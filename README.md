# Airline_Passenger_Referral_Prediction
## **Abstract:**
Air business as we know has been largely affected due to Covid-19 and most of the airline now is sitting on the verge of Bankruptcy because of this situation. Any bad decision may lead to severe outcomes where no stakeholder wants to invest without any future assurance. As an example of Singapore airlines who are among the hardest hit. As we know this situation is not permanent and it will be over but once this is over there will be a high surge as people will be back for holidays overseas. What can airlines do to tackle this situation? To answer this question, a machine learning model for classification is created from the airline_reviews dataset. This dataset has been  provided to us by Almabetter in order to identify the important factors that lead to better customer satisfaction.
